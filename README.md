# Ask a Human MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and web UI for human-in-the-loop question answering. This project allows you to:

- Serve questions to a human operator via a modern web interface
- Store and manage (question, context) → answer pairs in an in-memory database
- Integrate with the MCP protocol for use in agent workflows
- View, filter, and answer questions in a responsive, Bootstrap-powered UI

## Features

- **MCP Server**: Implements the Model Context Protocol for agent/human collaboration
- **Web UI**: Single-page application for listing, filtering, and answering questions
- **In-Memory Database**: Fast, thread-safe storage of questions and answers
- **Live Updates**: UI auto-refreshes and shows connection status
- **Modern UX**: Responsive design, keyboard shortcuts, and modal dialogs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24+

### Running the Server

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd mcp-human-go
   ```
2. Build and run:
   ```sh
   go run ./cmd/mcp-human-go
   ```
3. Open the web UI:
   - Visit [http://localhost:8990/ui](http://localhost:8990/ui) (or the port configured in your settings)

### Configuration

You can configure the server using environment variables or a `.env` file in the project root (or in your XDG config directory). The following options are supported (see `internal/config/config.go`):

| Variable    | Default | Description                                 |
|-------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| `WEB_PORT`  | `8990`  | Port for the web UI/API                     |
| `SSE_PORT`  | `8989`  | Port for the SSE (event) server             |
| `MAX_WAIT`  | `60`    | Max wait time (in seconds) for human answer |

You can create a `.env` file like this:

```
WEB_PORT=8990
SSE_PORT=8989
MAX_WAIT=60
```

Or set variables in your shell before running:

```sh
export WEB_PORT=8990
export MAX_WAIT=60
```

### Usage
- New questions are added to the in-memory database and appear in the web UI.
- Click a question to view details and answer it in a modal dialog.
- Use the filter to hide answered questions.
- The UI shows when the backend is unreachable and resumes when reconnected.
- Use Ctrl+Enter to submit answers quickly.
