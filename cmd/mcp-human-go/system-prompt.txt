Provided are various tools to request information from a human. Use the 'ask_human' tool 
when you need information that only a human would know, such as project-specific context, 
local environment details, or any information that is not publicly available or documented. 
The human will be notified of your request and their response will be returned to you.

Note: don't use this tool to clarify user intent, but only to find information that neither
you nor the user have readily available.
